# conjugator
Conjugator for languages, currently supporting Korean and Hindi. Quickly look up a verb and its usage! 

The conjugator takes in a verb and a grammar form and output the conjugated word. For example, the future form of ‘하다’(to do) should return ‘할꺼야’(will do). This API will come handy for people who are learning a new language or, if you’re like me, building a language learning app (https://llip.io).
